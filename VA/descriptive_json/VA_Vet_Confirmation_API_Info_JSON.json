{"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"title":"Veteran Confirmation","description":"The Veteran Confirmation API returns whether a given person is `\"confirmed\"` or\n`\"not confirmed\"` as a [Title 38 Veteran](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38).\nConfirming a Veteran's status can be useful for determining eligibility for\ndiscounts, services, preferential treatment, and certain jobs or education\nprograms.\n\nA Veteran is a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space\nservice, and who was discharged or released under conditions other than\ndishonorable. `\"ACTIVE DUTY\"` service history in the Reserves and National\nGuard is considered active military.\n\nA person may have served without being entitled to the VA benefits of a Title\n38 Veteran. If so, this API will return a `\"not confirmed\"` status. Reasons\nfor this can include dishonorable character of service or insufficient length\nof `\"ACTIVE DUTY\"` service, dates of service, or disability details.\n\n**Important:**\nThis API does not provide details about a person's service experience or\ninsight into why a person is `\"not confirmed\"` as a Title 38 Veteran. The\n[Veteran Service History and Eligibility API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/verification/docs/veteran_verification?version=current)\nhas different authentication methods and can provide additional information\nabout Veterans. Veterans can obtain additional information about their service\nhistory on [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/).\n\n## Technical Overview\n\n### Authentication and Authorization\nThis API requires an API key together with identifiable information for\nthe person being confirmed. API requests are authorized through a symmetric\nAPI token provided in an HTTP header with the name 'apikey'.\n\n### Test data\nWe use mock test data in the sandbox environment. APIs accessed via the\nSandbox environment are using the same underlying logic as VA's production\nAPIs; only the underlying data store is different.\n\nUse these [test user attributes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts/confirmation_test_accounts.md)\nin sandbox to populate the request body as only test users can return a\n`\"confirmed\"` response. In sandbox, only a test user's date of birth and\nzip code are used to identify a Veteran.\n\n","contact":{"name":"developer.va.gov"},"version":"0.0.2"},"servers":[{"url":"https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/veteran-confirmation/{version}","description":"Sandbox","variables":{"version":{"default":"v1"}}},{"url":"https://api.va.gov/services/veteran-confirmation/{version}","description":"Production","variables":{"version":{"default":"v1"}}}],"tags":[{"name":"veteran_confirmation_status","description":"Veteran Confirmation - Veteran Status"}],"paths":{"/status":{"post":{"tags":["veteran_confirmation_status"],"summary":"Confirms an individual's Veteran status.","description":"Get confirmation about an individual's Veteran status according to the VA.
